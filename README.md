# Cube Solver Rust

Starting with a 2x2x2 pocket cube, then going from there.

## Current ideas for further development

- Make command line interface for trying different scramble count and brute
  force limits. Could show time elapsed after running brute force as well.
- Implement for 3x3x3 Rubiks cube and reorganize cube code to align with two
  different cube types
